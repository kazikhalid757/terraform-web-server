# 🚀 Deploy a Static Website on AWS S3 Using Terraform

This project uses **Terraform** to provision an **Amazon S3 bucket** and configure it for static website hosting. The infrastructure is fully automated, including **S3 bucket creation, bucket policies, and public access configuration**.

---

## 🛠️ Features
✅ Deploy a static website using **Amazon S3**  
✅ Configure **public access** for the bucket  
✅ Set up an **S3 bucket policy** to allow public access  
✅ Use **Terraform state management** with **S3 backend** (Optional)

## 🔧 Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed before running the project:

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) (latest version)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (configured with credentials)
- An AWS account with **S3 access**

---

## 🚀 Setup & Deployment

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/terraform-s3-static-website.git
cd terraform-s3-static-website
```

### **2️⃣ Initialize Terraform**
```bash
terraform init
```

### **3️⃣ Validate the Terraform Configuration**
```bash
terraform validate
```

### **4️⃣ Plan the Infrastructure**
```bash
terraform plan
```

### **5️⃣ Apply the Configuration**
```bash
terraform apply
```
Type **`yes`** when prompted.

---

## 📌 Terraform Configuration

### **1️⃣ S3 Bucket Configuration**
The **S3 bucket** is created in `modules/s3/main.tf`:
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "mywebapp-bucket" {
  bucket = var.bucket_name
  website {
    index_document = "index.html"
    error_document = "index.html"
  }
}
```

### **2️⃣ S3 Bucket Public Access Policy**
This allows public access to the **static website**:
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "mywebapp" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.mywebapp-bucket.id
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [
      {
        Sid       = "PublicReadGetObject",
        Effect    = "Allow",
        Principal = "*",
        Action    = "s3:GetObject",
        Resource  = "${aws_s3_bucket.mywebapp-bucket.arn}/*"
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

### **3️⃣ Public Access Block (To Allow Public Access)**
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.mywebapp-bucket.id
  block_public_acls       = false
  block_public_policy     = false
  ignore_public_acls      = false
  restrict_public_buckets = false
}
```

---

## 🌍 Accessing the Website
Once Terraform applies successfully, the **website URL** will be displayed in the output:

```bash
Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:
website_url = "http://your-bucket-name.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
```

You can **access your static website** by visiting the above URL.

---

## 🚀 Destroying the Infrastructure
If you want to delete the S3 bucket and all associated resources, run:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
Type **`yes`** when prompted.

---

## 🔥 Next Steps
- Enable **CloudFront CDN** for better performance  
- Add an **SSL certificate** for HTTPS support  
- Use **Route 53** to set up a custom domain  

---

## 📜 License
This project is **open-source** and free to use.
